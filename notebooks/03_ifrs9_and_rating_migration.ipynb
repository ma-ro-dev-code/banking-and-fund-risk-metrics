    "- **Stage 1** exposures typically contribute a relatively small share of total Expected Loss,\n",
    "  reflecting performing loans with limited credit deterioration.\n",
    "- **Stage 2** exposures show a materially higher loss contribution due to lifetime ECL recognition\n",
    "  following a significant increase in credit risk.\n",
